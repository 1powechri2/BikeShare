**What is BikeShare?**
  This repo is for a web app for a project in the Back End Engineering Program at the Turing School of Software and Design.  All contributors to this project were current students in that program, in the second module (weeks 7 through 12) of the program.  BikeShare is an example website using a Postgresql database created from several large CSVs of data.  More information on the data being used and more information on what is contained in this data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share.

  BikeShare is a Rails project using Rails 5.1.6, and utilizes ActiveRecord.  All advanced database queries were made using ActiveRecord rather than SQL.

  BikeShare utilizes the `bcrypt` gem for password security, and proper utilization of namespaced resources and before_action callbacks to control authorization.  BikeShare properly utilizes session data to maintain login sessions and carts, session logic is intended to mimic real-world restrictions for visitors, users and Admin users.
